## Landing Page with personalized video which triggers Phone Calls

Find two HTML files in this project.

The first one, `landingpage.html` provides a base template from which to start building a landing page with the interactive video already embedded.

The second one, `snippet.html` is a piece of code prepared to be inserted in any other website or template and loaded directly in the browser.

In both cases a [default MP4 video has been provided](https://e.idomoo.com/2204/0000/sj2v0e1p23082m182fm3c1nx02b1s9211hb1wm1p3elg.mp4), however add the query string parameter `?url=<VIDEO_URL>` to load on demand any video.
